# multiple-linear-regresion-dummies
This multiple linear regression cromprises the use os dummies due to one of the predictors is of categorical type
In this case I use the method .map() to map the two classes 'with view and 'with no view' of the property which price will be predicted.
The prediction is made using the .predict() method of the result passing a data frame where each row is a property.
